Problem Description :
A lot of people buy tickets for events, travel, or accommodations for which they eventually find that they cannot attend due to last-minute conflicts. Hence, most of the times tickets go waste and money and chances are also lost. There are, however, some buyers who require last-minute tickets for events or services that are either sold out or inaccessible at regular channels. Current Resale Ticket Platforms: the likes of StubHub or special travel platforms, limit the services to be offered or charge rather high service fees, while most others are classified-lack proper secure transaction-handling which makes them unreliable.
