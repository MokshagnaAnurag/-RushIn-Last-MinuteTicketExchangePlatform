Problem Description :
Many people purchase tickets for events, travel, or accommodations only to find they cannot attend due to last-minute conflicts, leading to wasted tickets and lost money. At the same time, some buyers seek last-minute tickets for sold-out events or services unavailable through regular channels. Current resale platforms, such as StubHub, often charge high fees or limit offerings, while other options, like classifieds, lack secure transaction handling, making them unreliable.
